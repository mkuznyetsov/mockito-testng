## History

The original TestNGListener was a part of the core Mockito repository. However, the jar was never released. Core Mockito team does not work with TestNG so it was hard for us to maintain TestNG integration. In Summer 2018 we moved the TestNG integration to a separate repository under "Mockito" organization on GitHub.

## Help

We are looking for maintainers of TestNG integration. Let us know if you want to join! Mockito core team has limited capacity and focuses on the core library.
